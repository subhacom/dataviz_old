dataviz is a GUI utility for viewing HDF5 datasets. 

It is written in Python.  It uses PyQt4 for PyQwt5 for GUI. h5py for
reading HDF5 files. numpy is used for array/matrix data structures.

It was developed for analyzing neuronal simulation data saved in a
custom format. But the interface is generic enough to display simple
HDF5 files. The tools are totally for neuronal data analysis. But the
plan is to make it a more general tool.
